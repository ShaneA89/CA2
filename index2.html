Neo-classical influences can be seen in the colonnaded entrance and the domed rotunda, which rises to a height of 20 metres, and is modelled on the Pantheon in Rome.
          Within the rotunda, classical columns - made of marble quarried in counties Cork, Kilkenny, Galway, Limerick and Armagh - mirror the entrance.
          In the great centre court, a balcony is supported by rows of slender cast-iron columns with elaborate capitals and bases decorated with groups of cherubs. On the balcony, further rows of plain columns and attractive openwork spandrels support the roof.</td><!-- (p) Author@ https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Archaeology -->
