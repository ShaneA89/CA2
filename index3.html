        <td>Food Experience</td>
        <td>Gabriel Faherty was left the family farm on Inis Mór and was already involved in tourism on the island doing historical tours. His interest in cheese was sparked by a gift from his wife, Orla.
          She gave him a cheese course for his birthday. It was run by the Irish Seed Savers Association. There he met Marion Roeleveld from Killeen Cheese who was the course tutor.
          The fact that his first pet was a baby goat might have been a clue to which animal’s milk he would use to make cheese back at home.
          He set up Aran Goats Cheese in 2011. The cheese production plant is now a visitor’s centre and one of the stops on Aran Food Tours, also run by Gabriel.
          Visitors can meet the goats, watch the cheese being and obviously, taste it!</td> <!-- Author@ https://arangoatcheeseandfoodtours.com/our-story/ -->

        <td>Guarding a strategic ford on the Clarinbridge River is the monumental bulk of Athenry Castle. The imposing three-storey hall-keep survives from the mid-thirteenth century. It is solidly impressive from the outside, although the interior was simply built, containing only a hall at first-floor level and dark storerooms below.
          Despite the simplicity of the layout, fine carvings bear witness to the hall’s eminence. The doorway and two of the window openings are decorated with floral motifs in the remarkable local School of the West style. The battlements, through whose tall arrow-loops the castle was defended against various attackers across the centuries, are original.
          Visitors come to Athenry Castle to soak up the authentic atmosphere of medieval power that the mighty fortress still exudes.</td><!-- Author@ https://heritageireland.ie/places-to-visit/athenry-castle/ -->

        <td>Historic Sites</td>
        <td>Built by the fourth earl of Clanricarde, Portumna Castle was the de Burgo family power base for centuries.
          The castle is a unique example of the transitional Irish architecture of the early 1600s. Its bold design combines elements of medieval and Renaissance style that complement each other perfectly.
          A major fire in 1826 left the castle a roofless shell, but the state began to bring it back from ruin in the 1960s. Restoration work continues to this day.
          The dramatic walk up to the building includes charming formal gardens, which create an enchanting sense of the original seventeenth-century setting. The walled kitchen garden is particularly memorable.
          The castle enjoys a sensational view of Lough Derg. The ground floor is open to the public and houses an exhibition that brings the story of the castle and the de Burgo family to life. It is right beside the River Shannon and Portumna Forest Park, which makes it a great choice for a delightful day out.</td><!-- Author@ https://heritageireland.ie/places-to-visit/portumna-castle-and-gardens/ -->

        <td>Situated in the West of Ireland in County Galway, Connemara National Park covers some 2,000 hectares of scenic mountains, expanses of bogs, heaths, grasslands and woodlands. Some of the Park’s mountains, namely Benbaun, Bencullagh, Benbrack and Muckanaght, are part of the famous Twelve Bens or Beanna Beola range. Connemara National Park was established and opened to the public in 1980.
          Much of the present Park lands formed part of the Kylemore Abbey Estate and the Letterfrack Industrial School, the remainder having been owned by private individuals. The southern part of the Park was at one time owned by Richard (Humanity Dick) Martin who helped to form the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals during the early 19th century. The Park lands are now wholly owned by the State and managed solely for National Park purpose.</td> <!-- (p) Author@ https://www.connemaranationalpark.ie/ -->

        <td>The remains of the original de Burgo Hall were uncovered in 1997 when work began on a proposed extension to The Custom House. The hall was originally a church like structure with large, round headed windows and opposing entrances in its south-eastern end. In essence, it acted as medieval equivalent of a tax-office, courthouse and town-hall rolled into one. It is thought the hall was probably abandoned towards the end of the 15th century when the 14 ‘tribe’ families of Galway usurped the De Burgo’s influence over the town. The hall was reported to be in a ruinous state by the middle of the 16th century while the famous 1651 map of Galway certainly shows it as that. Galway Civic Trust has presented the Hall to the public since moving to its new offices in 2009.</td> <!-- (p) Author@ https://galwaycivictrust.ie/index.php/projects/ -->

        <td>Located just over one hour from Galway City, Kylemore Abbey is one of Ireland’s top tourist attractions. Kylemore Castle was built in the late 1800s by Mitchell Henry MP, a wealthy businessman, and liberal politician. Inspired by his love for his wife Margaret, and his hopes for his beloved Ireland, Henry created an estate boasting ‘all the innovations of the modern age’. An enlightened landlord and vocal advocate of the Irish people, Henry poured his life’s energy into creating an estate that would showcase what could be achieved in the remote wilds of Connemara. Today Kylemore Abbey is owned and run by the Benedictine community who have been in residence here since 1920.</td> <!-- Author @ https://www.kylemoreabbey.com/ -->

        <td>Irish Workhouse Centre/td>
        <td>Historic Site</td>
        <td>The Act for the effectual Relief of the Destitute Poor in Ireland was passed in July 1838. The Poor Law Act placed the workhouse building as a central component in every Union in Ireland. Its purpose was to provide for those who could not provide for themselves. These people were the most vulnerable in society, the old, sick, orphans, and those who had no job, money, or food. Each workhouse was managed by a Board of Guardians, consisting of elected and ex-officio members.
          The first workhouse to open in Ireland was built in Cork and began to admit paupers on 1 March 1840 and could accommodate 2,000. Portumna Workhouse opened in 1852, though Portumna Poor Law Union, the area within which the Workhouse operated, was declared on 22 February 1850. The building was constructed to accommodate 600 people and like other workhouses was designed by architect George Wilkinson. It cost £7,875 to build and occupies just over 8 acres of land outside the town.
          In all, there were 163 workhouses operating in Ireland until the 1920s built in two phases. The first 130 opened prior to 1850 and the latter 33 were provided in the aftermath of An Gorta Mór.
          After this time, the buildings in Portumna were used for many other purposes; an agricultural show was held here, a weaver worked in one of the buildings, and a potato store also operated here for a time.</td> <!-- Author@ https://irishworkhousecentre.ie/about/ -->

          holiday home. Pearse is best remembered for his role as one of the leaders of the 1916
          Rising, but he was also a significant journalist, poet, dramatist and teacher, and Ros Muc and
          its people had a huge influence on his writing. At that time Ros Muc was one of the strongest
          Irish-speaking areas of Ireland, and it remains so today.</td> <!-- Author@ http://www.icpconamara.ie/ -->
